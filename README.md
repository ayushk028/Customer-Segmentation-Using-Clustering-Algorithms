## 📌 What is Customer Segmentation?

Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a customer base into distinct groups based on common characteristics such as demographics, purchase behavior, and income. It helps businesses deliver personalized marketing and improve overall engagement.

---

## 🎯 Objective

This project demonstrates how unsupervised machine learning techniques can be used to identify meaningful customer segments in a mall dataset. Multiple clustering methods were explored and visualized to evaluate grouping effectiveness.

---

## 💡 Key Highlights

- ✅ Implemented **K-Means**, **Hierarchical**, **Gaussian Mixture**, **Mini-batch KMeans**, and **DBSCAN** for segmentation
- ✅ Visualized clusters using **PCA** and **2D scatter plots**
- ✅ Evaluated cluster quality using **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score**
- ✅ Created marketing personas to assist business decision-making

## 🧰 Tech Stack & Tools Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- PCA
- Power BI (for business-level dashboards)
